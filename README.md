# ðŸ“š Library3000App â€“ Innowise Internship


ðŸŽ¯ **Internship Goal**
The goal of the internship was to create a comprehensive library management application, starting from a simple console program and evolving into a full-scale microservices system with advanced security mechanisms, support for large datasets, and cloud scalability.

* BCrypt password hashing
* Secured endpoints with access control

**Task 9: Testing**

* Unit tests (JUnit, Mockito)
* Integration tests with Testcontainers
* REST controller tests
* Ensuring code quality

**Task 10: Microservices Architecture**

* Split into 4+ microservices (Gateway, Auth, Book, Image)
* Spring Cloud Gateway + Config Server
* Service discovery via Consul
* Circuit Breaker pattern (Resilience4j)

**Task 11: Docker + Kafka**

* Containerization of all services
* Docker Compose to run the full environment
* Asynchronous communication via Apache Kafka
* SonarQube + Checkstyle integration

**Task 12: Kubernetes + Monitoring**

* Deployment on Kubernetes cluster (Minikube)
* Helm charts for external services
* Monitoring via Prometheus + Grafana
* Java application profiling

**Task 13: Advanced Topics**

* Redis caching for performance optimization
* Implementation of additional mechanisms
* System optimization
* Preparing for production deployment
